# NAME
group1_task1.py - Python program for finding opening reading frames (orfs).

# SYNOPSIS
group1_task1.py [-h] [-s] [-o] input

# DESCRIPTION
This is a Python program that allows a .fasta file to be inputted and outputs a new .fasta file containing a list of open reading frames (orfs) from the original nucleotide sequence. Any
orfs containing ambiguous nucleotides marked as "n", are removed from the final list of orfs for convenience. The orfs are labelled in the format ">CLAUD-X-Y-Z", where "CLAUD" is the
species tag, "X" is the direction that the sequence is being read (5'3'/3'5'), "Y" is the reading frame and "Z" representes the Zth orf in that specific reading frame, this value begins at
1 again when a new reading frame is started. This is step 1 of 4 in a proteome analysis pipeline to model mass-specta for a collection of specified digestion enzymes. The full pipeline
consists of the following programs: "group1_task1.py" ; "group1_task2.py" ; "group1_task3.py" ; "group1_task4.py"

# OPTIONS
-h, --help	show help message and exit
-s, --size	minimum number of amino acids in open reading frame, defaults to 50 if not specified
-o, --output	pathway and name of output file, defaults to "group1_task1_output.fasta" if not specified

# EXAMPLES
python3 group1_task1.py genome.fasta -s 300
:	Finds all open reading frames in the file "genome.fasta" that are greater than or equal to 300 amino acids in length. The output is then written to a file named
	"group1_task1_output.fasta" located in the current working directory.

python3 group1_task1.py genome.fasta -o task1.out
:	Finds all open reading frames in the file "genome.fasta" that are greater than or equal to 50 amino acids in length. The output is then written to a file named
	"task1.out" located in the current working directory.

# DIAGNOSTICS
If no input argument is entered, this raises the following error
:	"error: the following arguments are required: input"
